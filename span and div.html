            A paragraph is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with
            a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.
            Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually
            an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.

            <span style="color:red">The purpose of a paragraph is to express a speaker or writer's controlling 
            idea and to support it with specifics.</span> Most paragraphs in an essay have a 
            three-part structureâ€”introduction, body, and conclusion.

            <span style="color:blue">The introduction (first sentence) sets the stage for what follows and states 
            the main point.</span> The body (sentences 2-4) develops that point with supporting 
            details and explanation. The conclusion (last sentence) reaffirms the main point 
            or sums up what has been said.
